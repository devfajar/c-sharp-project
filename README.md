# 🖥️ C-Sharp-Project

## 🎯 Overview

Welcome to my **C# Practice Repository**! This is a collection of small, hands-on C# programs created to sharpen my skills and deepen my understanding of key programming concepts. It serves as my personal learning space, where I explore, experiment, and grow as a developer.

## 🚀 What's Inside

The repository contains simple yet effective C# programs, each focusing on a different topic. These include:

- **📄 Basic Syntax & Data Types**: 
  Learn how to work with variables, data types, and basic input/output operations.

- **🛤️ Conditional Statements**: 
  Practice decision-making logic using `if-else` and `switch-case`.

- **🔁 Loops**: 
  Implement loops like `for`, `while`, and `do-while` to repeat tasks.

- **🛠️ Methods and Functions**: 
  Create reusable blocks of code with parameters and return values.

- **🗃️ Arrays & Collections**: 
  Understand how to use arrays and collections like `List` to store and manage data.

- **🧱 Object-Oriented Programming**: 
  Build classes, create objects, and learn about constructors.

- **🚨 Exception Handling**: 
  Handle errors gracefully using `try-catch` blocks.

- **📂 File I/O**: 
  Experiment with reading and writing files using `System.IO`.

## 💻 How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/C-Sharp-Project.git
   \`\`\`

2. **Open in Your IDE**:
   I recommend using **Visual Studio** or **Visual Studio Code**. Open any program and run it to see the output.

3. **Explore and Modify**:
   Feel free to tweak the code, add new features, or adjust the logic to better suit your learning needs.

## ✍️ Notes

This is my personal space for practicing C# programming, and the code is primarily for learning purposes. Some programs may be a work in progress or subject to further improvement.
